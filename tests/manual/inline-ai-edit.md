## Test Cases

### TC-001: Happy Path - Basic Text Transformation

**Priority**: P0
**Objective**: Verify basic select → instruct → generate → apply flow

**Steps**:
1. Open the test note
2. Select the sentence: "This is a sample paragraph..."
3. Trigger inline edit via:
   - **Option A**: Right-click → "Edit with AI"

**Steps**:
1. Select any text
2. Open inline edit modal
3. Enter instruction: "Translate to French" (something that takes time)
4. Click "Generate"
5. **Immediately** click "Cancel" while loading spinner is visible
6. Verify:
   - Generation stops
   - Modal returns to INPUT state (instruction input visible)
   - No error message shown
   - Can enter new instruction and try again

**Expected Result**: Clean cancellation without errors

---

### TC-003: Retry from Result State

**Priority**: P1

2. Select text and open inline edit modal
3. Complete generation (get to RESULT state)
4. **Without closing the modal**, click on a different note (Note B) in the file explorer
5. Click "Apply" in the modal
6. Verify:
   - Error notice appears (e.g., "The editor has changed. Please try again in the active editor.")
   - Text in Note B is **NOT** modified
   - Text in Note A is **NOT** modified (since it's no longer active)
   - Modal remains open OR closes gracefully

**Expected Result**: Safe failure - no unintended edits to wrong file

---

### TC-007: Rapid Generate/Cancel Sequences (HIGH RISK)

**Priority**: P0 (Flagged by Coder)
**Objective**: Verify stability with rapid user interactions

**Steps**:
1. Select text and open modal
2. Enter instruction
3. Perform rapid sequence:
   - Click "Generate"
   - Immediately click "Cancel"
   - Immediately click "Generate" again
   - Wait for result
4. Verify:
   - No errors or crashes
   - Final state is consistent (either INPUT or RESULT)
   - Modal is responsive

**Variations to test**:
- Generate → Cancel → Generate → Cancel → Generate
- Generate → (wait 1 second) → Cancel → Generate

**Expected Result**: System handles rapid interactions gracefully

---

### TC-008: Model Dropdown Edge Case (MEDIUM RISK)

**Priority**: P1 (Flagged by Coder)
**Objective**: Verify behavior when no models are available

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily disable all LLM providers in settings (remove API keys)
2. Restart Obsidian or reload plugin
3. Select text and attempt to open inline edit modal
4. Verify:
   - Modal opens (or shows helpful error)
   - If modal opens, dropdown shows meaningful state (empty or "No models available")
   - Generate button is disabled OR clicking it shows helpful error

**Expected Result**: Graceful handling of no-models scenario

---

### TC-009: Markdown Preservation

**Priority**: P1
**Objective**: Verify markdown formatting is preserved through transformation

**Steps**:
1. Select the blockquote text: `> This blockquote has some **formatting**...`

   - Bold formatting (`**...**`) is preserved
   - Result renders correctly in preview mode

**Expected Result**: Markdown formatting survives round-trip

---

### TC-010: Special Characters Preservation

**Priority**: P1
**Objective**: Verify special characters are not corrupted

**Steps**:
1. Select the special characters line: `Special characters: "quotes" & 'apostrophes'...`
2. Open inline edit modal
3. Enter instruction: "Keep this exactly the same but add a period at the end"
4. Generate and Apply
5. Verify:
   - Quotes, ampersand, apostrophes are preserved
   - Unicode Chinese characters (中文) are preserved
   - Emoji (🚀) is preserved

**Expected Result**: No character corruption or encoding issues

---

### TC-011: Undo After Apply (Ctrl/Cmd + Z)

**Priority**: P1
**Objective**: Verify editor undo works after applying AI changes

**Steps**:
1. Note the exact original text
2. Complete a full transformation (TC-001)
3. With cursor in the editor, press Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Z (Mac)
4. Verify:
   - Original text is restored
   - No additional undo steps required

**Expected Result**: Single undo restores original text

**Implementation Note**: The `editor.replaceRange()` Obsidian API is used to apply changes. This API automatically integrates with Obsidian's native undo stack. Undo functionality is expected to work without additional implementation because `replaceRange` is the standard Obsidian editor API that preserves undo history.

**Verification Criteria**:
- After clicking "Apply" and confirming the change is visible in the editor
- Pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Z once should restore the exact original text
- The undo operation should be atomic (single step, not character-by-character)

---

### TC-012: Code Block Transformation

**Priority**: P1
**Objective**: Verify code blocks can be transformed

**Steps**:
1. Select the code block content (inside the fences)
2. Open inline edit modal
3. Enter instruction: "Convert to arrow function syntax"
4. Generate and Apply
5. Verify:
   - Code is transformed appropriately
   - Syntax highlighting still works
   - No extra escaping introduced

**Expected Result**: Code transformation works correctly

---

### TC-013: Long Text Selection

**Priority**: P2
**Objective**: Verify handling of large text selections

**Steps**:
1. Create or find a note with a very long section (1000+ words)
2. Select the entire long section
3. Open inline edit modal
4. Verify:
   - Selected text preview is truncated appropriately (with "...")
   - Full text is sent to LLM
5. Enter instruction: "Summarize this"
6. Generate and Apply
7. Verify transformation completes without timeout

**Expected Result**: Long text handled within reasonable time

---

### TC-014: Mobile Testing (Hotkey Only)

**Priority**: P2
**Objective**: Verify hotkey access works on mobile (no context menu)

**Steps** (on mobile device or tablet):
1. Open Obsidian mobile app
2. Open a note and select text
3. Use command palette to find "Edit selection with AI"
4. Trigger the command
5. Verify modal opens and workflow functions

**Note**: Context menu is not available on mobile - this is expected behavior per design decision.

**Expected Result**: Feature accessible via command palette on mobile
