# Nexus MCP for Obsidian

Nexus gives AI agents and built-in chat access to your Obsidian vault so you can read, write, search, organize, and automate notes in natural language while keeping storage local to the vault.

Nexus can be used in two ways:
- Inside Obsidian with native chat (hook up to your favorite provider or agentic platform!)
- From external agents like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Cline, and other MCP clients

> Nexus is the successor to Claudesidian. Legacy installs in `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/` still work.

## Setup

- Install the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/releases): `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, `main.js`, and `connector.js`
- Put them in `.obsidian/plugins/nexus/` and enable **Nexus** in Obsidian
- Native chat in Obsidian: [Provider setup](guide/provider-setup.md) and [Native chat guide](guide/native-chat.md)
- External agent over MCP: [MCP setup guide](guide/mcp-setup.md) and [Recommended system prompt](guide/recommended-system-prompt.md)
- Optional desktop features: [Semantic search](guide/semantic-search.md) and [Apps and integrations](guide/apps.md)

Native chat works on desktop and mobile. MCP clients, local desktop providers, and semantic search are desktop-only.

| Extend Nexus with downloadable apps | [Apps](guide/apps.md) |

## Prompt For Your Agent

If you want another agent to walk you through setup, paste this:

```text
Help me set up Nexus for Obsidian and guide me step by step.

Use these docs as the source of truth:
- README: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/blob/main/README.md
- Provider setup: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/blob/main/guide/provider-setup.md
- MCP setup: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/blob/main/guide/mcp-setup.md
- Recommended system prompt: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/blob/main/guide/recommended-system-prompt.md
- Native chat guide: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/blob/main/guide/native-chat.md

Start by figuring out whether I want native chat inside Obsidian, an external MCP agent, or both. Ask for my OS and the agent I want to use if that matters. Then walk me through the exact setup path, one step at a time.

When a config file needs to be edited, show the exact snippet with my vault path inserted. Do not invent config formats or skip restart/reload steps. If multiple setup paths are possible, recommend the simplest one first.
```
