/**
 * Bases availability probe + the headless `nexus-analyze` view registration.
 *
 * ## Why one function does both
 *
 * `Plugin.registerBasesView(viewId, registration)` returns `false` when Bases is
 * not enabled in the vault (public API, `@since 1.10.0`). That single call is
 * therefore both the availability probe and the registration `analyze` needs —
 * so the agent is registered only when the call succeeds, and a vault with Bases
 * off never sees the `base` commands in discovery at all (plan §3). A tool that
 * can only answer "not available" wastes a discovery round-trip.
 *
 * `minAppVersion` is 1.8.7 and the method only exists from 1.10.0, so the
 * `typeof` guard comes first. For the same reason the `BasesView` base class is
 * dereferenced lazily, inside the view factory: `class X extends BasesView` at
 * module scope would throw "Class extends value undefined" on 1.8.7 and take
 * plugin init down with it.
 *
 * ## The registered factory outlives the module that registered it
 *
 * This is the single most important fact in this file, and it shapes everything
 * below. Obsidian keeps the registration until the app process ends. A plugin
 * *reload* gives Nexus a fresh module scope, but Obsidian goes on calling the
 * factory closure from the build that registered first. So:
 *
 *   - Nothing the view does may depend on module-scope state — the module it
 *     closed over may be a previous build's. The rendezvous below lives on a
 *     `globalThis` symbol for exactly that reason.
 *   - The view↔runner contract is a WIRE PROTOCOL between two builds, not an
 *     internal call. {@link ANALYZE_PROTOCOL_VERSION} names its version, the
 *     version is recorded next to the registration, and
 *     {@link analyzeViewProtocolVersion} lets `analyze` fail with "restart
 *     Obsidian" instead of hanging when the live view predates the runner.
 *
 * ### The frozen v1 protocol
 *
 * 1. The view's `onDataUpdated()` looks up `SINKS.get(this.config.name)` and
 *    calls it with the view itself. The view name is the rendezvous key because
 *    the runner chooses it (it writes the scratch view) and `BasesViewConfig.name`
 *    is public API.
 * 2. The view exposes the `QueryController` it was constructed with as
 *    `nexusController`, which is the only way to reach `getSummaryValue`.
 * 3. Harvesting happens on the RUNNER's side, from the live view object. Keeping
 *    the view this dumb is what stops a stale factory from being a stale
 *    serialiser too.
 *
 * Changing any of those three is a protocol break: bump
 * {@link ANALYZE_PROTOCOL_VERSION} and keep the old path working, because a user
 * who updates Nexus without restarting Obsidian keeps the old view.
 *
 * ## The two other spike findings this file exists to handle
 *
 * 1. **Registering a duplicate view id is not a no-op.** Obsidian keeps the
 *    FIRST registration, still returns `true`, and shows the user a `Notice`.
 *    Re-registering on every plugin reload would therefore be user-visible
 *    noise. So a successful registration is recorded on a `globalThis` symbol,
 *    which outlives the plugin's module scope but not the app process — the
 *    same lifetime as Obsidian's own registration table. A reload of Nexus then
 *    reuses the recorded result instead of registering again.
 *
 *    Only successes are recorded. A `false` (Bases off) is deliberately NOT
 *    cached, because "enable Bases, then reload the plugin" is the documented
 *    way to get the agent to appear and a cached `false` would defeat it.
 *
 * 2. **Toggling the Bases core plugin off wipes the registration table.** Our
 *    recorded `true` then describes a registration that no longer exists.
 *    {@link refreshAnalyzeViewRegistration} repairs that: it asks Bases whether
 *    the id is still live and re-registers when it is not. The probe reads
 *    Bases' own registration map, which is not public API, so it is entirely
 *    optional — when the shape is unrecognisable the answer is "assume live",
 *    which is exactly the pre-repair behaviour. Blind re-registration is NOT an
 *    option: it reintroduces finding 1 (a `Notice`) for every user who never
 *    touches the toggle.
