   * symptom — an empty or half-populated view — with nothing in the console
   * tying it back to a corrupt database. Issue #209 stayed undiagnosable for
   * months for exactly that reason.
   *
   * Only reached on a genuine failure. An absent, empty or older-schema cache
   * all take other branches and stay silent, so this line appearing at all
   * means something really was wrong with the blob.
   *
   * Deliberately `console.error` and nothing else. `logger.systemWarn` and
   * `systemLog` are no-ops in this build, so routing through them would
   * re-hide the event. A `Notice` is not raised here: this runs during cache
   * open, well before the workspace is ready, and this class is pure
   * persistence with no Obsidian dependency. `console.error` is what the
   * Obsidian developer console and `obsidian-cli dev:console` read, which is
   * where a bug report gets written from. Note it does NOT reach
   * `obsidian-cli dev:errors`: that surface reports uncaught exceptions, not
   * `console.error` calls - verified live on 2026-08-24 by corrupting a real
   * cache, where this line appeared in `dev:console` while `dev:errors` stayed
   * empty. So the release verification gate does not fail on this line; it is
   * discoverable, not alarming. If a user-facing surface is ever wanted, it
   * belongs to a caller that already owns UI, not here.
   *
   * This reports; it does not decide. Recovery itself is unchanged.
