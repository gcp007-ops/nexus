# Nexus playbook

This is a task primer. Below, in order, you get: **this spine**, **your
workspaces**, the **recipe**, and the **tools it needs (already discovered)** —
so you can go straight to `nexus use` without a separate `nexus tools` call.

**Every playbook starts the same way:**

1. **Pick a workspace and load it.** Choose from *Your workspaces* below and run
   `nexus use --memory … --goal … -- memory load-workspace "<name>"`. If
   none fits, create one with `memory create-workspace`. Loading scopes your traces
   and auto-loads that workspace's task summary. (This playbook only *lists*
   workspaces — loading is your call, since only you know which one.)
2. **Thread the workspace** into every following call with `--workspace <name>`
   (the outer context flag), and keep a stable `--session <name>` for the task.
3. **Always pass real `--memory` and `--goal`** — a running summary and the
   current objective. Placeholders are rejected.
4. **Checkpoint at milestones** with `memory create-state` so the work is
   restorable (archive is reversible; there is no destructive delete). It needs a
   few flags — `--name`, `--conversation-context`, `--active-task`, `--active-files`
   (array), `--next-steps` (array); run `nexus tools memory create-state` for the
   full schema.

Paths are vault-relative and confined — no `..`, `~`, or absolute escapes. **All
flags are kebab-case** — camelCase (e.g. `--activeTask`) is rejected as an unknown
flag; use `--active-task`.

For multiline Markdown/YAML or embedded quotes, keep content out of shell argv:
after `--`, pipe with `--content-stdin` or pass `--content-file <local-path>`
instead of `--content`.
