# Apps

Apps are downloadable tool domains that extend Nexus with third-party integrations. Each app brings its own tools, credentials, and API connections — install only what you need.

---

## Setup

Configure apps in **Settings &rarr; Nexus &rarr; Apps**. Install an app, enter your API key, hit **Validate**, then toggle it on. Apps install as disabled so you can configure credentials before enabling them.

## Available Apps

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: Composer, Web Tools, and Nexus Ingester are new and may have rough edges. Please [report issues](https://github.com/ProfSynapse/claudesidian-mcp/issues) if you run into problems.

| App | Tools | What It Does |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| **ElevenLabs** | textToSpeech, listVoices, soundEffects, generateMusic | AI audio generation — convert text to speech, create sound effects, and generate music. Audio files save directly to your vault. |
| **Nexus Ingester** *(experimental)* | ingest, listCapabilities | Convert PDFs and audio files in your vault to sibling Markdown notes. Two modes: **Manual** — right-click any supported file and choose "Convert to Markdown". **Auto** — enable "Auto-convert new files" in Settings → Defaults → Ingestion and any supported file added to the vault is converted automatically. PDF extraction uses text mode (pdfjs-dist) or vision OCR. Audio transcription supports OpenAI (Whisper, GPT-4o Transcribe), Groq (Whisper), and Google Gemini multimodal audio. |
| **Composer** *(experimental)* | compose, listFormats | Combine multiple files into one. Merge PDFs, concatenate Markdown files, or mix and concat audio tracks. Audio output supports WAV, WebM/Opus, and MP3 (via WASM). Supports per-track volume, offset, and fade controls for audio mixing. |
| **Web Tools** *(experimental, desktop only)* | openWebpage, capturePagePdf, capturePagePng, captureToMarkdown, extractLinks | Open any webpage in a headless browser and capture it as a PDF, PNG, or clean Markdown (boilerplate stripped). Also extracts all links with their text and type. Requires desktop — not available on mobile. |

Want to build your own? See **[Building Apps](../docs/BUILDING_APPS.md)** — an agentic prompt you can feed to your AI coding assistant to create a new app from scratch. It covers the full pattern: manifest, agent class, tools, vault file saving, and registration.
