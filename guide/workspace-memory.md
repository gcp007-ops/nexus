# Workspace Memory

All Nexus data lives inside the plugin directory:

```
.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-folder>/
├── data/
│   ├── conversations/*.jsonl   # Chat history (syncs across devices)
│   ├── workspaces/*.jsonl      # Workspace events
│   └── tasks/tasks_*.jsonl     # Task/project events per workspace
└── cache.db                    # SQLite cache (auto-rebuilt, not synced)
```

JSONL files are the source of truth (sync-friendly). SQLite is a local performance cache that rebuilds automatically. Because the `data/` folder lives inside the plugin directory, Obsidian Sync includes it automatically.

## Workspaces

Workspaces scope your sessions, traces, and operations. Every tool call is tagged to a workspace via the context schema.

- Create and load workspaces via tools or the chat UI
- **Search by name fragment** instead of listing everything — `memory search-workspaces "research"` ranks matches across name, description, and folder, and `--load` opens the workspace directly when exactly one matches
- **Save states** to capture a point-in-time view of your workspace context
- Archive workspaces and states for cold storage (restorable)
- No external database required

When a workspace loads, its **recent activity** is grouped by session and carries the memory, goal, and constraints captured with each trace — so the AI sees not just *what* happened recently but *why*.

### Progressive loading

For ordinary routing and workspace entry, prefer the compact response:

```powershell
nexus use --memory "entering a known workspace" --goal "load its navigation" -- memory load-workspace "NeuroAI Mapping" --detail compact
```

Compact mode returns only workspace identity, ordered key-file and workflow
references, and an explicit list of omitted full-response branches. Read
`mustRead: true` references first and expand only the branch required by the
request:

- note or workflow content: `content read --path <path> --start-line 1`;
- saved continuity: `memory load-state` when the user asks to resume;
- project or task state: task tools only for an explicit resume, pending-work,
  next-step, or DAG request;
- folder structure: `storage list --path <path>`.

Use `--detail full` when the comprehensive legacy briefing is actually needed.
`full` remains the default during migration. In that mode, `--limit` bounds
sessions, states, and recent activity; compact mode omits all three as well as
task data, so lowering `--limit` does not make compact mode more compact.

## Workflows

Use workflows when you want reusable, workspace-scoped operating procedures instead of one-off prompts.

Each workflow can:
- Describe **when** it should be used
- Store **steps** in plain language
- Bind an optional **saved prompt or agent**
- Run immediately with **Run now**
- Run automatically on a **recurring schedule**

### Supported Schedules

| Schedule | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|
| Hourly | Every N hours |
| Daily | At a selected hour and minute |
| Weekly | On a selected weekday, hour, and minute |
| Monthly | On a selected day of month, hour, and minute |

### Catch-Up Behavior

When Obsidian was closed during a scheduled run:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Skip missed runs | Ignore missed schedule slots |
| Run latest missed | One catch-up run for the newest missed slot |
| Run all missed | One run per missed slot, in order |

### Triggering Workflows Via Tools

AI agents can trigger workflows programmatically using `memory run`:

- `--workflow-id` or `--workflow-name` — which workflow to run
- `--open-in-chat` (optional) — open the resulting conversation

The target workspace comes from the call's `workspaceId` context field, not a
flag on the tool.

Scheduled and manual runs create a fresh chat conversation titled `[workspace - workflow - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm]`.

## Task Management UI

In addition to the [task management tools](task-management.md), Nexus has a built-in settings UI.

Open **Settings &rarr; Nexus &rarr; Workspaces**, then:

1. Click **Manage Projects**
2. Open a project card
3. Review tasks in the project task table
4. Use the checkbox to mark tasks done or reopen them
5. Click **Edit** to open the full task editor

### UI Structure

- **Workspace detail** &rarr; project/task entrypoint
- **Project cards** &rarr; one card per workspace project
- **Project detail** &rarr; task table with status, priority, due date, assignee, actions
- **Task detail** &rarr; editor for title, description, status, priority, due date, assignee, tags, project, parent task, plus **Dependencies** (depends-on / blocks) and **Linked notes** (with link type) sections

The database is the source of truth. Edits made in chat and in settings operate on the same underlying data.
