# Spreadsheet Mirror + Write-back — Manual Test Guide (Obsidian desktop)

What to run once the branch is built/deployed into a real Obsidian desktop vault.
Everything below the unit layer (hucre download + Blob-import, real `.xlsx`
parsing, vault binary write) is **first-run validation** — it has not executed
outside the headless test container.

## 0. Build + deploy

```
npm run build          # main.js ~4.79MB (<5MB); hucre is NOT bundled
```
Copy `main.js` + `manifest.json` + `styles.css` into
`<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/nexus/` (or `npm run deploy`). Reload Obsidian.

## 1. Enable the app

Settings → **Apps** → enable **Data Analysis** (desktop-only). It exposes four
tools: `runPython`, `listCapabilities`, **`mirrorWorkbook`**, **`applyToWorkbook`**.

## 2. First-run engine download (the riskiest new path)

The first `mirrorWorkbook`/`applyToWorkbook` call triggers a one-time download of
the hucre engine (~300 KB) from esm.sh into
`.obsidian/plugins/nexus/hucre/hucre-xlsx.mjs`, then loads it via a Blob-URL ESM
import. **Verify:**
- A Notice "Setting up the spreadsheet engine — downloading once…" appears, then
  "Spreadsheet engine ready."
- The file lands in the `hucre/` folder and is ~300 KB.
- ❗ If the load fails, the likely culprits are (a) esm.sh `?bundle` not producing a
  self-contained file, or (b) Electron CSP blocking the Blob import. Fallbacks:
  pre-vendor the file manually, or switch the load to `file://` import.

## 3. Mirror a workbook

Put a real `budget.xlsx` (multiple sheets, some **formulas**, ideally a **chart**)
in the vault. Ask the AI (or call the tool) `mirrorWorkbook { path: "budget.xlsx" }`.

**Expect:** `<Nexus root>/spreadsheets/budget/` containing `manifest.json` and
`<Sheet>.part0.csv` per sheet. Check:
- Sheet order + `rowCount`/`colCount` look right.
- `manifest.sheets[].formulaCells` is **non-empty** for sheets with formulas
  (this proves the XML formula-scan works → the write-back guard is active).
- A large sheet (>`maxShardBytes`, default per Settings → Data) splits into
  `.part0/.part1/…` with contiguous row ranges.
- Re-running mirror on the unchanged file reports `regenerated: false`.

## 4. Edit → AUTOMATIC write-back

The round-trip is **automatic**: editing any mirror `.partN.csv` triggers a
debounced (~1.5s) write-back to the source `.xlsx` — no explicit tool call needed.
Edit a CSV two ways:

- **With pandas (code edits the CSV):** `runPython` with `outputPath` pointing at
  a mirror shard and a `.csv` extension, e.g.
  `inputs:{data:"Nexus/spreadsheets/budget/Data.part0.csv"}`,
  `outputPath:"Nexus/spreadsheets/budget/Data.part0.csv"`, code that returns a list
  of rows/records (`df.to_dict("records")`). The result is written as CSV.
- **With CRUD:** `contentManager replace/insert` on the `.partN.csv` text.

Either way, ~1.5s after the edit settles:

**Expect:**
- A Notice: "Synced N change(s) to budget.xlsx …".
- The `.xlsx` updates, and — critically — **the chart and all formatting survive**
  when you open it in Excel (the whole point of hucre vs openpyxl).
- A snapshot under `spreadsheets/budget/_archive/<ts>/`.
- The mirror re-projects (manifest `sourceHash` changes) **without looping**
  (the watcher suppresses its own re-projection writes).
- ❗ In Excel, confirm formulas downstream of your edit **recalculate** (hucre
  writes values; Excel recalcs on open).

`applyToWorkbook` still exists for a **manual/preview** path — call it with
`dryRun: true` to see the change set, or `force: true` to override the divergence
guard — but you don't need it for the normal flow.

## 5. Guard checks

- **Formula guard:** edit a cell that `manifest.formulaCells` lists → `applyToWorkbook`
  should report it under `cellsBlocked`/`blockedFormulaCells` and NOT overwrite it.
- **Divergence guard:** edit `budget.xlsx` directly in Excel after mirroring, then
  `applyToWorkbook` → expect `reason: "divergence"` (refused). `force: true` overrides.
- **No-op:** apply with no CSV edits → `reason: "no-changes"`.

## 6. Known gaps to watch (from the plan §11/§12)

- **Sheet→worksheet-part mapping** is the sorted-Nth `sheetN.xml` approximation.
  On a multi-sheet workbook, confirm edits land on the RIGHT sheet and the right
  sheet's formulas are detected. If not, the precise fix is workbook-rels mapping.
- **`.xlsm`/macros:** a macro workbook should keep working; confirm the write-back
  doesn't corrupt it (hucre flags `hasMacros`).
- **hucre's 8/135 unsupported features:** if a workbook uses one, the write-back may
  not round-trip it — the plan calls for a pre-scan refusal (not yet implemented).
  For now, eyeball exotic workbooks after write-back.

## 7. What's already proven (don't re-test)

Headless unit tests cover: CSV (de)serialization + sharding, mirror generation
(idempotency, stale-shard cleanup sparing `_archive/`, name collisions), the diff
+ formula-guard + coercion, the write-back orchestration (apply/dryRun/divergence/
no-op/snapshot/re-project), the formula-cell XML scan, and hucre's byte-intact
preservation of an unmanaged part (spike S2). The manual pass is specifically about
the **Electron-bound edges**: engine download/load, real `.xlsx` fidelity, and the
vault binary write.
